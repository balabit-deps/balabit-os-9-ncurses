Description: Debian changes to xterm* terminfo entries
 The "rep" feature has been removed from xterm-new and derived terminfo
 descriptions, as it causes compatibility problems with older terminal
 emulators.
 .
 The xterm-debian terminfo entry is provided as an alias for xterm, as
 some ancient Debian systems used xterm-debian as $TERM.
